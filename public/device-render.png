PLACEHOLDER: Replace this file with your actual product image.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Save the GateFire product image you shared as: device-render.png
2. Place it in the /public/ folder (replace this file)
3. Recommended size: 1200x1600px or higher
4. Keep the black background - the code will blend it automatically

The CSS will create an ink-stain effect that blends the black background into white.
