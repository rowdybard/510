PLACEHOLDER: Replace this file with an actual device render image.

For development, you can use a placeholder image service or create a simple product mockup.

Recommended size: 600x600px or larger (square format)
Format: PNG with transparency
File name: device-render.png

Until you add a real image, the site will show a broken image icon.
You can use a service like https://placehold.co/600x600/orange/white?text=GateFire+510 for testing.
